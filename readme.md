Tasks: Start to build QUIC server using golang        
Server: Tencent Cloud with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS      
Framework: https://github.com/traefik/traefik document: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/      
First, we need to install docker to our system, https://linux.cn/article-14871-1.html,      
and see the command: sudo docker run hello-world runs successfully.       
Next is to install Docker Compose and follow the same tutorial above.     
--> sudo -s --> cd compose --> docker-compose up -d reverse-proxy --> open http://localhost:8080/api/rawdata

Tasks: ROS Simulation      
Build workspace: mkdir catkin_ws --> cd catkin_ws --> mkdir src --> cd src --> git... -->          
cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make --> source ./devel/setup.bash         
To avoid each catkin_make and we need to add environmental variable, we use sudo gedit ~/.bashrc to change the file. source ~/catkin_ws/.... -> export ROS_PACKAGE...         
In ROS Gazebo, we obtain same turtlebot controlled by key value

The blue balls are designed to move randomly using Unity AI, and the red balls have two actions: if the blue ball collide with them, the count will plus one, and if two red balls are too closer, it will move far away.

Tasks: Basics of Docker and Traefik      
traefik is an edge router, when we start traefik, we need to first define entrypoints,  and based on the routers connected to these entrypoints, we need to see if these routers match a set of rules. If the rules match, then the routers we input will go through middlewares. After the conversion, it is forwarded to the real services.      
For traefik, to discover the services, we need to use connectors which are called providers because they provide the configuration to Traefik. Provider can automatically discover services on the platform, and the provider could be Docker or Kubernetes, etc.. Here we use Docker Provider for traefik configuration, and for Docker startup, we use Docker Compose here. For compose, it simplifies the control of the entire application stack, which can easily manage services in a single easy-to-understand YAML configuration file. Then, using a single command, you can create and start all the services from the profile. the simple example in https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/ to run Docker Compose

Tasks: Learn Simple Sample of Docker Compose    
1. mkdir composetest -> cd composetest -> touch app.py / touch requirement.txt -> add flask,redis     
2. create Dockerfile, in same dir, touch Dockerfile, and the Dockerfile is used to create Docker Image.       
3. touch compose.yaml -> docker compose up -> open http://localhost:8000/

Tasks: TLS challenges for Traefik       
1. The concern is to use https on a simple service exposed with Traefik, and TLS stands for Transport Layer Secure. TLS is often used to combine with HTTP -> https -> more secured       
2. Shake hands mechanism for TLS -> Client sends 'Client Hello' message to Server -> Server sends 'Server Hello' message to Client, including Certificate, SercerKeyExchange, CertificateRequest, ServerHelloDone -> Client processes 'Server Hello' and sends 'ClientKeyExchange' --> Server 'Finished?' --> Exchange Data       
3. While we use Docker to run traefik, here are three files needed: docker-compose.yaml & dynamic.yaml & traefik.yaml(Optional)         
4. mkdir tls -> cd tls -> touch docker-compose.yaml -> version: "3.3" service: traefik: -> ports: 80(http)443(https)8080(dashboard) tbc.....
